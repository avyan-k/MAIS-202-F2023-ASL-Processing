# MAIS-202-F2023-ASL-Processing

## About the Project

Basic Sign Language Translator that interprets ASL language using Machine Learning from a webcam stream and outputs the corresponding letter:

 * Uses Convolutional Neural Networks
 * Model is trained using [Kaggle ASL Alphabet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lexset/synthetic-asl-alphabet)
 * Written in Python Version 3, using PyTorch
 
# Requirements
 Use Python Version 3  and install the following packages (tentative list):
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and utilities, including torchvision
* [opendatasets](https://pypi.org/project/opendatasets)

# Usage
Run [pytorch_version.py](https://github.com/avyan-k/MAIS-202-F2023-ASL-Processing/blob/main/src/pytorch_version.py) to load the data. Training the model will be implemented at a later time.
