- Data normalization goesn't have weird color anymore like green/red/bue (i just changed the mean and std deviation ) but it doesn't work on dark background with dark skin tone.

- Resized to 256x256 instead of 512x512

- the mnist dataset work on our model (when we mimic the lecture model)

- our dataset doesn't work on the mimiced lecture model

- tried removing all the convo layers basically to just have a simple mlp but it still didn't work
