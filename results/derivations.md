# Tuning Weight Regularization
With tune_mean_std() we get:

- training dataset:
    - mean:[0.4916, 0.4699, 0.4255]
    - standard deviation:[0.1582, 0.1646, 0.1767]

- validation dataset:
    - mean:[0.4921, 0.4698, 0.4243]
    - standard deviation: [0.1588, 0.1651, 0.1769]

- testing dataset:
    - mean:[0.4904, 0.4686, 0.4246]
    - standard deviation:[0.1587, 0.1656, 0.1776]

After approximating the best weight from it we get:

- mean: [0.4916,0.4697,0.4251]
- standard deviation: [0.1584,0.1648,0.1768]
